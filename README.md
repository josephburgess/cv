An analytical, logical thinker, highly motivated by the prospect of a career in software engineering. With a background in both
finance and communications, I recently discovered that coding comes naturally to me and allows me to use both my creative
and analytical skills in a positive way. I am a self-starter and have spent several months teaching myself the foundations of
software engineering in my spare time outside of full-time work. I have used resources such as Codecademy and Udemy to gain
foundational knowledge of JavaScript, Ruby, HTML, CSS, Node.js and Git/Github. Outside of this, frequently doing coding
challenges on Codewars has given me an acute appreciation of beautifully clean code and test-driven development.
