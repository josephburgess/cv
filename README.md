## Skills ü§π

#### Technically minded problem solver

Ever since I got my hands on my first Windows 3.1 PC in the 90s, I have been captivated by the incredible possibilities of computing and tech. I've always been eager to learn and have even built PCs for myself and my loved ones, while leveraging my coding and scripting skills to streamline everyday tasks. The thrill of learning never fades for me, and I'm always looking for new ways to challenge myself.

#### Inquisitive tinkerer with a knack for automation

When I'm not busy building computers or learning new programming languages, I enjoy tinkering with home devices and finding ways to make them work smarter and better together. Whenever I build a new PC, the old one becomes the home NAS server, where I host my media and files and run docker containers with services such as Jellyfin, Pi-Hole and Synology to serve my other devices. Platforms like IFTTT have been a game-changer for me, and I'm always on the lookout for new tools and resources to streamline and optimize my tech setup.

#### Business savvy communicator

I have spent seven years in Financial PR, helping hundreds of companies to communicate their investment case when seeking funding, both through public and private markets. This experience, along with time spent in investment banking while studying for my MBA has given me excellent communication skills and professionalism, as well as a keen understanding of what makes a good business.

#### Self Starter

My drive to learn and grow is insatiable, and before fully taking the plunge with Makers I dedicated countless hours outside of my full time job to self-teaching the fundamentals of software engineering. Sites like Codecademy and Udemy were invaluable resources in my quest to expand my knowledge base and sharpen my skills. Completing coding challenges on platforms like Codewars also gave me a deep appreciation for clean, efficient code and the importance of test-driven development early in my journey.

Overall, I'm a highly motivated, enthusiastic tech-lover with a strong desire to take on new challenges, learn new skills, and make a meaningful impact in the world of tech.
