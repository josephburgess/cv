## Skills ü§π

#### Technically minded problem solver

My first computer was a Windows 3.1 PC in the 90s. Since then I have had a strong passion for computing and tech. I have frequently built PCs for myself and friends and family and used coding and scripting to automate tasks for convenience. Whenever I upgrade my PC the old box becomes the new NAS Home server, having taught myself to use Docker to self-host my media and cloud data. I also use services such as IFTT to automate and improve interactions between home devices.

#### Business savvy communicator

I have spent seven years in Financial PR, helping hundreds of companies to communicate their investment case when seeking funding, both through public and private markets. This experience, along with time spent in investment banking while studying for my MBA has given me excellent communication skills and professionalism, as well as a keen understanding of what makes a good business.

#### Self Starter

I am a self-starter and spent several months teaching myself the foundations of software engineering in my spare time outside of full-time work. I have used resources such as Codecademy and Udemy to gain foundational knowledge of JavaScript, Ruby, Docker, HTML, CSS, Node.js and Git/Github. Outside of this, frequently doing coding challenges on Codewars has given me an acute appreciation of beautifully clean code and test-driven development.
